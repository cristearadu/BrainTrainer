# BrainTrainer

By creating this application I learned using:
  * Buttons ;
  * CountDownTimer ;
  * GridLayout ;
    
The purpose of this game is to chose the correct answer for the additions of random numbers between 0 and 20.
The countdown timer starts at 30 seconds.
There are 3 endings: 
  - scoring lesser than 5 points : bad ending;
  - scoring between 6 and 30 points : good ending;
  - scoring greater than 30 : perfect ending.
